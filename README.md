# Blog Application

### Description
This is a trivial blog app, started with create-react-app. It works entirely within memory, so reloads blow everything away except for the first two mock articles. I made this blog application using firestore, firebase, authentication, vs code 2, etc. This is my favorite assignment I've done so far for the class.
